## What is it?
Like a screen saver, SAM comes on when your MiSTer is idle. It will launch a random game from your library every few minutes. If you like a game that's currently playing, just pick up your controller and push a button, press a key, or move the mouse. SAM will start another game once you return to the main menu. Then the gaming tour begins again!
