Actual Board Revision: 3.1 (Commit: [319f0d8](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Hardware_MiSTer/tree/319f0d8e7f890be3a142081aef5020b61d513411/Addons/IOBoard))

The MiSTer IO Board is an **optional** expansion board for the DE10-Nano FPGA Board. It adds the following features to the MiSTer Platform:
* VGA Connector
* 3.5mm Audio Jack
* Optical Fiber Connector (TOSLINK)
* 3x Pushbuttons
* 3x Status LEDs

All this can be either mounted directly on the IO Board or externally by connectors (e.g. case mounted)
