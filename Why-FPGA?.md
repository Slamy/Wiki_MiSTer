Generic potential user will eventually ask: Why you need to use FPGA while other proven solutions exist such as Raspberry Pi?

There are debates how to call the process of simulating of real hardware in FPGA. Some people insist it's not emulation but real HW replica while any simulation on traditional CPU should be called as emulation. I have my own opinion here :) From my point of view, if FPGA code is based on real circuit of real hardware (with usual tweaks for FPGA compatibility) then it's called a replica. Anything else is emulation. Currently it's hard to find the core which can be called as replica - most cores are based on more or less functional re-creation rather than real circuit re-creation. So, it's ok to call FPGA cores as emulators unless it's proven as replica.

Go back, to original question - Why FPGA if it's also just emulation? 
Well, FPGA emulation is fundamentally different than emulation on CPU. Traditional emulator on CPU executes the code sequentially. This is a tricky way of emulation because real hardware has many chips and all of them are working in parallel. CPU, Video chip/logic, audio chip, memory arbiter - all of them are working at the same time. So traditional emulator has to take care of all these parts and try to emulate the whole this orchestra at the same time. It requires a lot of CPU power to emulate some old and slow retro computer. Sometimes even modern CPU working on 100x speed of retro computer is not enough, so emulator has to use approximation or skip emulation of some less important parts, or assume some standard work of emulated system without extraordinary usage. Let's take a well known UAE emulator emulating Amiga. On Raspberry Pi 3 you can run some Amiga CPU benchmark and get crazy numbers like 100x of original 68000. So, you can assume you have an emulated Amiga which is 100x faster than real one. No, you don't. If you ran different kinds of demo/games you will see video is stuttering sometimes. For example, if you play "State of The Art" demo, you will notice video stuttering at some points while real Amiga 600 with 1x CPU speed plays the whole demo very smooth. 
This is how traditional emulators on RPi/PC work. 

FPGA emulation works very different from traditional emulation on CPU. FPGA is a very large array of simple triggers and other logic. Exactly the same as all chips/CPUs. The only difference is that specific chip/CPU have such triggers/logic permanently connected while FPGA allow to connect them like you want. A special HDL language describe how to connect all these triggers/logic cells. Everything in FPGA works in parallel like in original chips/devices. Thus FPGA is pretty much close to original HW. FPGA doesn't need high frequencies to emulate retro computers, so it works at much lower frequencies than traditional emulators require. Since everything in FPGA works in parallel, there is no problem to handle any possible usage of emulated system. Developer on FPGA usually concentrate on specific part to make it work - and it will work as it should in any possible scenario. In the same reference demo "State Of the Art" you can see a smooth video through whole playback as on original HW. 

You wanna ask: Why don't make all emulators on FPGA then? FPGA programming is not so trivial. Every bit in FPGA works in parallel, so developer should think in parallel as well :) What is trivial on CPU, is not trivial on FPGA. Although some parts trivial on FPGA costs a lot on CPU code.
