This page is a quick guide on status for most available cores. 


# SuperStar Cores #

These are the most polished cores which are either feature complete or very close,
with integration with the latest no-lag scaler and other features.

Cores listed here will be the most complete in terms of features,
and are recommended for a basic beginner MiSTer installation.
