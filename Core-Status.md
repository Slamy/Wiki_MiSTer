# Core Status #

Cores on MiSTer are the result of the collaboration between many people and extensive testing, sometimes over many years and prior open-source projects.  Most console and computer cores have now been compared to general hardware, with the few issues remaining documented on their respective github repository pages. Please refer to these pages, per core, before submitting any issues.

The links on the sidebar will bring you to the release folder on github, which will also allow you to find the know issues page and the readme files listing all available features in detail.

High level, there are some known limitations on some cores. These are listed below until they are addressed.
