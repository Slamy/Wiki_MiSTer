**Under Construction - Pardon our dust!**

This page is a quick guide on status for most available cores. 


# SuperStar Cores #

These are the most polished cores which are either feature complete or very close,
with integration with the latest no-lag scaler and other features.

Cores listed here are recommended for a basic beginner MiSTer installation. 

(Note to those who fill the tables: you need to refrain from your wishes written as "missing" features.)

# Good Cores #

These cores work well but are missing some key features to be considered a full replacement of original hardware. Installation is only recommended for medium users who understand the main limitations.

# Advanced Cores / Needing Setup #

These cores are functional but need more setup than cores above.
Most Arcade cores fall into this category, so won't be listed individually.

Use of these cores is only recommended to medium to advanced users.

# WIP Cores #

These cores are still under development, and while functional, cannot be considered close to complete.
Installation and use is not recommended for most users (only advanced users willing to tinker).
