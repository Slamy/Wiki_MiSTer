MiSTer has the ability to capture screenshots of a running core. This is useful for many things, including "saving" passwords.

Press **Win** + **Print Screen (âŒ˜ + F13)** .

The snapshots are captured directly from the core video output before it is scaled and be fore any filters are applied (in other words, it saves at the core's native video resolution).

Output files are stored in /media/fat/screenshots/
