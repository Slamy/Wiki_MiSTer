MiSTer has the ability to capture screenshots of a running core. This is useful for many things, including "saving" passwords.

Press **Win** + **Print Screen** .

The snapshots are captured directly from the core video output before it is scaled and filters are applied (in other words, at the core's native resolution).

Output files are stored in /media/fat/screenshots/
