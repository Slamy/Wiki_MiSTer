MiSTer has the ability to capture screenshots of a running core. This is useful for many things, including "saving" passwords.

Press **Win** + **Print Screen (âŒ˜ + F13)** to capture a screenshot from the scaled video output. In order to instead grab a screenshot at the core's native video resolution, press **Win** + **Left Shift** + **Print Screen**.

Output files are stored in /media/fat/screenshots/
