When overriding gamepad settings inside a core it is possible to define button combinations (e.g. A+B) if you have enough physical buttons.

To allow for this, MiSTer will ask if you want to setup "alternate mappings" after defining a gamepad.

Alternate mappings are active in parallel and allow two kinds of abilities: map two physical button to the same core button (e.g. alternate button for Start), or map one physical button to two-button combo in the core (e.g. map physical X to thr core's A+B).

## Basic alternate mapping

The simplest is to map an extra physical button. Only the additional buttom needs to be defined:

| **DPad** | **Btn 1** | **Btn 2** | **Btn 3** |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
|a|b|c|d|
|a|b|c|d|
