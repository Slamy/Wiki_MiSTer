When you've gotten your DE10-Nano FPGA board, then you probably want to get your hands on an add-on board like the SDRAM or IO board. There are two ways to do that:

### 1. Do It Yourself

If you are a bit technically gifted or just want to learn how to assemble PCBs by yourself, then head over to the "Assembly (DIY) guides in the sidebar and make your own boards! You can discuss and share your experiences with us here:

### 2. Buy / Sell IO Boards
Since the PCBs are always ordered in batches of at least 5 boards, most DIY users have some boards left. If you are looking for a IO board or you have some left from your last assembly, check the sale threads:
